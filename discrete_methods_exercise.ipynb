My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn’t think to ask, please include that as well.\n",

    "5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?\n",
